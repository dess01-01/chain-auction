# Chain Auction - WIP
Chain auction is a decentralized auction engine built on a Hyperledger Fabric Network.
Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology, leveraging familiar and proven technologies. It is a modular architecture allowing pluggable implementations of various function. It features powerful container technology to host any mainstream language for smart contracts development. Smart Contracts are defined on Hyperledger Fabric Composer.

The demo contains 5 users along with 3 Products that can be auctioned. For see users and ownership see '104.211.186.61:3001/users'

## Auction Process
- The user from `/users` clicks on the product to create an Auction Listing for the product.
- The user then fills in details regarding the auction.
    - Right now the listing id is not generated automatically, assign a listingid "list\<any non used number\>", ex "list4"
    - Set the Reserve Price
    - The state of the Auction Listing is set to  **PENDING**, Pendeing approval from the auctioneer
    - Auction type specifies the type of auction the user wants.
- Upon successful creation of an Aution LIsting, it is listed at `/auctioneer`, where the auctioneer has the option to approve a requested Auction Listing upon which the state is change to **APPROVED**
- `/` Listis all the currently open (APPRIVED) auctions in which the users can participate.
- Users can place bids on a particular Auction Listing at `/listing/<lisingId>/`
    - Here the 'User ID' is the user's email id and the 'Bid' the amount he is willing to bid for the item.
- `/auctioneer` also has the option for the auctioneer to end an ongoing acution. 
- Upon ending the auction by the auctioneer, the state of the Auction Listing is set to either **RESERVE_NOT_MET** or **SOLD** depending on the outcome of the auction.
- After updating the new ownership and balance can be seen at `/users`
- `/listingDetails/<listingId>` displays the details about the AuctionListing specified by listingId.
- `/users/<user_email_id>` displays details about the user specified by the email id.

## Structure 
`fabric-composer-network` contains files for defining the business network (Smart Contracts) for the application.

`auction-web` contains files for the web application built with React JS

## Running the Application
### Fork the repository
`$ git clone https://github.com/sidd607/chain-auction.git` 
### Setting up the Fabric Nerwork
Follow the steps from [Hyperledger Composer docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/development-tools.html) to setup a Fabric Network
### Developing and deploying the Busines Network
The Business Network definition consists of 3 major components
- Model Files - Define the structure and realationship between model elements
- Script Files - Implement the Business Logic for the application.
- Access Control File - A set of access control rules that define the rights of different participants in the business network.
